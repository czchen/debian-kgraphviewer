Description: a GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE 4
 KGraphViewer is a GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE 4. The graphviz program
 suite is a free software set of layout engines for graphs. They are commonly
 used in scientific domains and particularly in computer science. But until
 now there was a lack of a GUI to look at the graphs. Programs provided with
 GraphViz are: I feel, out of date X11, or Tcl/Tk applications with few
 Functionalities. KGraphViewer is aimed at replacing these tools with a modern
 user-friendly GUI will all the power of a well integrated KDE application.
