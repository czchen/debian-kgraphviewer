Description: GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE 4
 KGraphViewer is a GraphViz dot graph viewer for KDE. The graphviz program
 suite is a free software set of layout engines for graphs. They are commonly
 used in scientific domains and particularly in computer science. But until now
 there was a lack of a modern GUI to look at the graphs.
 .
 KGraphViewer is aimed at replacing these tools with a modern user-friendly GUI
 with all the power of a well integrated KDE application.
